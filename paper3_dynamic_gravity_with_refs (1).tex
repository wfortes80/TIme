\begin{abstract}
We extend our six-dimensional emergent curvature model by introducing a dynamic matter-coupling mechanism wherein the coherence field $\tau_2$ on a compactified 2-sphere directly modulates both the geometry and the gravitational coupling strength of 4D spacetime. A warp field $\sigma(x)$ governs internal curvature, yielding a variable effective gravitational constant $\kappa_4(x)$. We define an emergence switch $\tau_3(x)$ as a smooth function of local coherence energy, enabling localized geometric transitions. Coupling ordinary matter fields to $\tau_2$ through $\tau_3$ reveals testable phenomena,including gravitational anomalies and resonance-triggered curvature events. We derive the dynamic Einstein equations for this framework and identify observational pathways for validation.

\section{Introduction}
This work builds on previous models of coherence-driven curvature in six dimensions \cite{fortes2025a,fortes2025b}, incorporating insights from dimensional reduction frameworks \cite{mtw1973,appelquist1987} and scalar field theory in curved space \cite{birrell1982}.

Emergent behavior in curved spacetimes often eludes classical description. In previous work, we introduced a six-dimensional geometry where coherence is encoded via a scalar field $\tau_2$ on a compact internal 2-sphere. While our earlier models allowed curvature feedback via a warp field $\sigma(x)$, the effective gravitational constant $\kappa_4$ was assumed fixed. Here, we generalize this by allowing $\kappa_4$ to become dynamic and field-dependent, derived directly from dimensional reduction of the 6D Einstein-Hilbert action. We also couple $\tau_2$ to an ordinary 4D matter field  $\psi(x)$, gated by and emergence function $\tau_3(x)$, to explore the physical consequences of coherence-induced curvature transitions.

 

\section{Geometric Framework and Dimensional Reduction}
We begin with a 6D manifold:
\[
M^6 = M^4 \times S^2
\]
with coordinates $x^A = (x^\mu, \theta, \phi)$.

The 6D metric is defined as:
\[
ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}(x) dx^\mu dx^\nu + e^{2\sigma(x)} (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\, d\phi^2)
\]

The 6D Einstein-Hilbert action is:
\[
S^{(6D)} = \frac{1}{2\kappa_6} \int_{M^6} d^6x\, \sqrt{-g_6}\, R_6
\]

Compactifying over the internal sphere $S^2$:
\[
\kappa_4(x) = \frac{\kappa_6}{4\pi e^{2\sigma(x)}}
\]

i.e., gravity in 4D depends locally on the compactified geometry.

The 4D reduced action becomes:
\[
S^{(4D)} = \frac{1}{2\kappa_4(x)} \int d^4x\, \sqrt{-g_4}\, R_4(x)
\]

\section{Coherence Field and Local Energy Density}
We define a scalar field $\tau_2(x^\mu, \theta, \phi, t)$ that lives on the internal 2-sphere but varies smoothly with 4D spacetime position. This allows localized coherence structures to evolve across the observable universe.

Its local energy density is:
\[
E_{\tau_2}(x) = \int_{S^2} d\Omega\, \left[ \frac{1}{2}(\partial_t \tau_2)^2 + \frac{1}{2e^{2\sigma}} |\nabla_{S^2}\tau_2|^2 + \frac{1}{2} m^2 \tau_2^2 \right]
\]

\section{Emergence Switch $\tau_3(x)$}
We define a smooth emergence function:
\[
\tau_3(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\beta (E_{\tau_2}(x) - E_{\text{crit}})\right)}
\]

This gates matter-curvature interaction. Where $E_{\tau_2} \gg E_{\text{crit}}$, $\tau_3 \to 1$, activating resonance-driven geometry shifts.

\section{Matter Coupling via Coherence}
We introduce a 4D scalar matter field $\psi(x)$ with Lagrangian:
\[
\mathcal{L}_\psi = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \partial_\mu \psi \partial^\mu \psi + m^2 \psi^2 + g \tau_2^2 \psi^2 \right)
\]

This yields the field equation:
\[
(\Box + m^2 + g \tau_2^2) \psi = 0
\]

Gravity now responds to $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$ only where $\tau_3(x)$ is active.

\section{Modified Einstein Equations}
With variable coupling:
\[
G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa_4(x) \left( T_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau_2)} + \tau_3(x) T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)} \right)
\]

This allows geometry to remain stable under weak coherence, but undergo significant change near local resonant zones.

\section{Observational Signatures}
We propose searching for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time-varying gravitational redshift near high-coherence objects
\item Modulated ringdown phases in gravitational wave events
\item Sudden phase shifts in quantum systems coupled to curved spacetime
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper presents a framework where gravitational strength varies with internal geometry, and matter interacts with spacetime only through a coherence gate. Next steps include extending to fermionic fields, exploring $\tau_3$ cascades, and simulating resonance transitions in numerical relativity.
