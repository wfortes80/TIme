\begin{abstract}
We refine and extend our curvature-memory model by providing a physical interpretation of the coherence field $\tau_2$ and defining the emergence function $\tau_3$ as a dynamical field governed by local coherence energy. This framework positions $\tau_3$ as a propagating order parameter that mediates geometric transitions through a self-consistent field equation. We present the complete system of coupled equations and demonstrate how the model resolves known issues in emergent spacetime theory, including extra-dimensional stability, varying gravitational strength, and causality under localized emergence conditions.

\section{Introduction}

The coherence field $\tau_2$ was previously introduced as a scalar field living on a compactified internal 2-sphere, influencing the curvature of observable spacetime. In this paper, we refine its interpretation by treating $\tau_2$ as a localized coherence density field modulated by 4D spacetime. We then define $\tau_3$ as a dynamical scalar field that responds to the local coherence energy $E_{\tau_2}(x)$, producing smooth, propagating emergence events.

\section{Physical Interpretation of $\tau_2$}

We define $\tau_2 = \tau_2(x^\mu, \theta, \phi, t)$ as a coherence field capturing the alignment or structured memory of internal field configurations across the compactified sphere $S^2$. Its local energy density is computed as:

\[
E_{\tau_2}(x) = \int_{S^2} d\Omega \left[
\frac{1}{2} (\partial_t \tau_2)^2 +
\frac{1}{2e^{2\sigma(x)}} |\nabla_{S^2} \tau_2|^2 +
\frac{1}{2} m^2 \tau_2^2
\right]
\]

This formulation allows us to localize coherence across spacetime and use $E_{\tau_2}(x)$ as the driver for emergence dynamics.

\section{Emergence as a Dynamical Phase Field}

We model $\tau_3(x)$ as a 4D scalar field with its own dynamics, governed by a potential dependent on coherence energy:

\[
V(\tau_3; E_{\tau_2}) = A (E_{\tau_2} - E_{\text{crit}}) \tau_3^2 + \beta \tau_3^4
\]

This yields the equation of motion:

\[
\Box \tau_3 = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial \tau_3} = -2A(E_{\tau_2} - E_{\text{crit}})\tau_3 - 4\beta \tau_3^3
\]

The dynamics of $\tau_3$ allow localized emergence events to propagate through spacetime as phase fronts or oscillatory domains.

\section{Coupled Field Equations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\tau_2$ dynamics on $S^2$:
    \[
    -\partial_t^2 \tau_2 + \frac{1}{e^{2\sigma(x)}} \Delta_{S^2} \tau_2 = m^2 \tau_2
    \]
    \item Coherence energy density:
    \[
    E_{\tau_2}(x) = \text{[as defined above]}
    \]
    \item $\tau_3$ evolution:
    \[
    \Box \tau_3 = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial \tau_3}
    \]
    \item Matter field equation:
    \[
    \left( \Box + m^2 + g \tau_2^2 \right)\psi = 0
    \]
    \item Warp field equation:
    \[
    \Box \sigma = \alpha E_{\tau_2}(x) - M^2 \sigma - \lambda \sigma^3
    \]
    \item Gravitational coupling:
    \[
    \kappa_4(x) = \frac{\kappa_6}{4\pi e^{2\sigma(x)}}
    \]
    \item Modified Einstein equations:
    \[
    G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa_4(x) \left[
    T_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau_2)} +
    \tau_3(x) T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)} +
    T_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau_3)}
    \right]
    \]
    \item $\tau_3$ stress-energy tensor:
    \[
    T_{\mu\nu}^{(\tau_3)} = \partial_\mu \tau_3 \partial_\nu \tau_3 -
    g_{\mu\nu} \left( \frac{1}{2} \partial^\alpha \tau_3 \partial_\alpha \tau_3 - V(\tau_3; E_{\tau_2}) \right)
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Theoretical Challenges and Model Response}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stability of Extra Dimensions:} The internal curvature is dynamically stabilized via the potential $V(\sigma) = M^2\sigma^2 + \lambda\sigma^4$, avoiding typical compactification instabilities.
    \item \textbf{Varying Gravitational Constant:} $\kappa_4(x)$ varies only near emergence zones, avoiding detectable deviation in weak-field domains.
    \item \textbf{Causality and Topology:} $\tau_3(x)$ evolves locally and does not require global topology changes, sidestepping no-go theorems.
    \item \textbf{Quantum Consistency:} The model is semiclassical, designed as a precursor to full quantization via an effective field theory lens.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

We have physically grounded the $\tau_2$ field as a local coherence descriptor and introduced $\tau_3$ as a dynamical emergence field driven by phase-transition-like behavior. The model now supports localized, evolving emergence zones that carry energy, influence curvature, and open pathways toward observation and simulation.
