\begin{abstract}
Building upon prior work modeling curvature memory and coherence-driven emergence in a six-dimensional spacetime framework, we introduce a physically grounded activation threshold for the emergence function $\tau_3(x)$. We identify the Planck power limit $P_\text{Planck} \approx 3.63 \times 10^{52} \, \text{W}$ as the critical coherence energy $E_\text{crit}$ required to activate observable geometric transitions. This reinterpretation aligns the model with quantum gravitational constraints and provides a natural quantization mechanism for localized emergence events. We refine the $\tau_3$ activation function accordingly and discuss implications for black hole memory, early-universe phase structure, and potential gravitational observables.

\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Note}: The recognition of the Planck power limit as a potential threshold for quantum-to-classical transition was recently popularized in public discourse by a 2024 article in \textit{The Sustainability Times}~\cite{Sustainability}. This article helped crystallize the idea that the Planck power is not merely a dimensional artifact, but may have real physical meaning at the boundary of classical spacetime structure. This popular insight inspired deeper mathematical exploration within the present work.

In previous papers~\cite{Paper1,Paper2,Paper3,Paper3Addendum,Paper4}, we developed a model in which a scalar field $\tau_2(x^\mu, \theta, \phi, t)$, defined across a compactified 2-sphere, stores localized coherence energy that can induce geometric transitions in 4D spacetime. The emergence function $\tau_3(x)$ mediates this activation and was originally modeled as a sigmoid or dynamic scalar field governed by local energy thresholds. However, the critical activation energy $E_\text{crit}$ remained a free parameter.

Here we identify $E_\text{crit}$ with the \textbf{Planck power} limit, the maximum physically meaningful power scale derivable from fundamental constants:

\[
P_\text{Planck} = \frac{c^5}{G} \approx 3.63 \times 10^{52} \, \text{W}
\]

This threshold represents the \textbf{upper bound of classical spacetime description}, beyond which quantum gravitational effects dominate. First discussed in early dimensional analysis by Planck (1899)~\cite{Planck1899}, this limit has since been adopted in quantum gravity literature as the dividing line between semi-classical regimes and fully nonlocal quantum domains~\cite{Padmanabhan1987,AmelinoCamelia2013}.

\section{Emergence Function with Planck Power Threshold}

We redefine the emergence function $\tau_3(x)$ as:

\[
\tau_3(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left[-\beta\left(E_{\tau_2}(x) - P_\text{Planck}\right)\right]}
\]

Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E_{\tau_2}(x)$ is the localized coherence energy derived from the compactified 2-sphere,
    \item $\beta$ determines the sharpness of the emergence threshold,
    \item $P_\text{Planck}$ acts as a universal quantization scale.
\end{itemize}

This definition enforces \textbf{discrete activation}: emergence only occurs when $\tau_2$'s coherence energy accumulates to the Planck power threshold, enabling phase-transition-like curvature release.

\section{Physical Interpretation and Implications}

\subsection{Coherence Storage and Quantized Emergence}
The $\tau_2$ field now operates as a \textbf{geometric memory system}, accumulating structured energy that remains latent until emergence conditions are met. Below the Planck threshold, spacetime remains unaffected. At the threshold, $\tau_3(x)$ activates, inducing geometric reconfiguration.

\subsection{Discrete Geometric Transitions}
This power-based gating mechanism transforms $\tau_3$ into a true \textbf{semi-classical emergence operator}, akin to a phase transition in condensed matter. Geometric transitions become localized, quantized events rather than continuous evolution.

\subsection{Bridge to Quantum Gravity}
This reframing connects the model to foundational themes in quantum gravity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Black hole memory}: Information may be encoded in $\tau_2$ fields and released via threshold-based $\tau_3$ activation
    \item \textbf{Early universe inflation}: Local domains surpassing Planck power could seed emergent structure
    \item \textbf{Gravitational wave spikes}: Ringdown events exceeding Planck limits may display nonlinear modulations traceable to $\tau_3(x)$ emergence fronts
\end{itemize}

\section{Observational Signatures}

This formulation predicts several potential observables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time-varying gravitational redshift} localized to coherent systems
    \item \textbf{Quantized ringdown phase shifts} during high-power gravitational wave events
    \item \textbf{Curvature-induced phase flips} in quantum systems exposed to localized geometric anomalies
\end{itemize}

While each of these remains speculative, they offer concrete targets for simulation and possible observational refinement.

\section{Conclusion}

Anchoring $E_\text{crit}$ in the Planck power limit transforms the emergence mechanism from a tunable function to a physically justified quantization rule. This integration unifies the six-dimensional coherence model with established thresholds in gravitational physics and opens a structured path toward experimental falsifiability.
